# RMIL Final Project - Teleoperation-Based Learning from Demonstration (LfD)
## Dynamic Bottle Throwing with Franka Emika Panda

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Learning from Demonstration (LfD)** framework on the **Franka Emika Panda** robot to reproduce a dynamic **bottle throwing task**. The robot grasps a bottle, aligns it, and throws it into a trash bin.

Using **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** and **Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR)**, the robot learns motion trajectories from human demonstrations and successfully reproduces a multi-phase throwing motion.

The project was developed as part of the RMIL laboratory course and serves as a foundation for further research in imitation learning and embodied intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Task Description

The robot performs a three-phase motion:

1. **Part 1 – Preparation Motion**
   - Move to bottle 
   - Grasp the bottle cap

2. **Part 2 – Transition Phase**
   - Move to pre-throw pose
   - Position refinement

3. **Part 3 – Throw Execution**
   - Fast motion and throw-velocity threshold detection
   - Additional yaw rotation (~1.5 rad/s)
   - Bottle release

The yaw rotation significantly improves the naturalness of the throw.

# 🕹 Teleoperation Framework

The haptic device provides:

- Cartesian translation control
- Gripper toggle
- Yaw / Pitch rotation
- Workspace scaling
- Force feedback

### Special Button Logic

When the freeze button is pressed:
- Linear velocity = 0
- Rotation mode activated

This enables precise alignment before throwing.

---

# 📊 Demonstration Data Structure

Each recorded CSV file contains:

- End-effector position (Xf_x, Xf_y, Xf_z)
- End-effector velocity (Vf_x, Vf_y, Vf_z)
- Force feedback (Fc_x, Fc_y, Fc_z)
- Gripper event
- Yaw rate command
- Pitch rate command
- Timestamp

This extended structure enables robust segmentation and modeling.

---

# 🔀 Task Segmentation

The task is divided into 3 segments:

1. **Segment 1** – Approach & Grasp
2. **Segment 2** – Lift & Pre-Throw Alignment
3. **Segment 3** – Throw & Release

### Segmentation Strategy

- Event-based (gripper open/close)
- Velocity threshold (detect throwing phase)

  S --> F2[Find kinematic cues: speed peaks / acceleration]
  F1 --> SEG[Segmentation]
  F2 --> SEG
  SEG --> P1[Phase 1: Approach & Grasp]
  SEG --> P2[Phase 2: Lift & Move to Pre-throw Pose]
  SEG --> P4[Phase 3: Throw & Release]
  ```
Segmentation improves stability and modeling accuracy.

# 📈 Learning Strategy

## Segment 1 & 2: Position-Conditioned GMM/GMR

We model the joint distribution:

P(x, v)

During reproduction:

v_t = E[v | x_t]

Then integrate:

x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t*Δt

This creates a smooth velocity field representation of motion.

---

## Segment 3: Velocity Primitive

Throwing is highly dynamic.

Instead of conditioning on position, we model:

P(v)

Reproduction:

v_{t+1} = Σ h_k*μ_k

This produces a stable velocity primitive suitable for explosive motion.

---

# 🔧 Segment Integration

In the LfD_combi node:

- Each segment is executed sequentially
- Independent parameter tuning per segment
- Throwing phase includes:
  - Pitch rate control
  - Release timing control
  - Vertical velocity scaling

---

# 🚀 Final Result

The robot autonomously performs:

✔ Grasp  
✔ Lift  
✔ Align  
✔ Dynamic Throw  
✔ Timed Release  

**The bottle successfully lands inside the trash bin.**

# 📌 Key Contributions

- Implemented hybrid probabilistic motion modeling
- Developed velocity primitive for dynamic motion
